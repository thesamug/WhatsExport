# **App Name**: WhatsExport

## Core Features:

- Contact Data Extraction: Automatically identifies and scrapes contact data (names, phone numbers) directly from the WhatsApp Web interface.
- Customizable Filtering: Filter contacts based on country code, labels assigned within WhatsApp, and date of last contact. Dates can be entered directly into the interface.
- CSV Export: Allows users to download the filtered contact data in CSV format.
- Smart Insights Dashboard: AI tool that identifies new patterns in WhatsApp contact communication, like most frequently contacted users, average response time or the topics most talked about, and displays these stats on a dedicated dashboard within the extension popup. This can also suggest contact groups based on these patterns.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A muted teal (#4DB6AC), offering a modern and professional feel. The hue is inspired by WhatsApp's green, but subdued to avoid direct imitation and maintain a distinct identity.
- Background color: A light, off-white (#F5F5F5) creates a clean and unobtrusive backdrop, ensuring excellent readability and a focus on the contact data.
- Accent color: A warm amber (#FFB300) provides visual highlights for key interactive elements, such as filter buttons and the export CTA, drawing the user's attention without overwhelming the interface. It's approximately 30 degrees away on the color wheel, complementing the muted teal and offering good contrast.
- Clean and easily readable sans-serif font to ensure the clarity of contact details.
- Simple, outline-style icons for filtering and data display.
- The popup window is clearly divided into 3 sections - the header contains main actions to do with the extension (like authorization), filtering area in the main view, and finally account and general settings in the bottom footer.
